## Overview
TheSecurePass Validator is an initiative aimed at enhancing online security by allowing users to verify the strength and uniqueness of their passwords. Given the increasing incidents of data breaches, ensuring that a password has not been compromised is more crucial than ever.

## Motivation
Data breaches have become increasingly common, with millions of passwords being leaked every year. According to a [2023 report by Verizon](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/), 81% of hacking-related breaches leveraged stolen or weak passwords. This project is designed to help mitigate such risks by providing an easy-to-use platform to check password safety.

## Features
- **Real-time Password Check**: Validate your password against a database of known compromised passwords.
- **Client-side Hashing**: Passwords are hashed client-side before being sent to the server, ensuring an additional layer of security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate front end developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **API Integration**: Leverages the "Have I Been Pwned" API to check for compromised passwords.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js/Flask
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing metrics and logs
- **Security**: SHA-256 for client-side password hashing
